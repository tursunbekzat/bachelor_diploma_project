### Title of the Project
**Development of a Cross-Platform Application Based on the Board Game "Bang!" for Mobile and Web Platforms with Multiplayer Support**

---

### Relevance of the Topic
In recent years, the digitization of board games has become a significant trend, enabling unique gameplay experiences in a digital environment and making them accessible to a broader audience. Adapting the board game *Bang!* into a cross-platform application (mobile and web versions) allows players to interact in real-time, regardless of the platform. This approach offers convenience, a choice of devices, and enhances social interaction among players. The project is relevant due to the growing demand for cross-platform solutions that provide flexibility and freedom of device choice for players.
